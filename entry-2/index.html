    <h3><p>Artist: The Temptations</p>
    <p>Released: 1965</p></h3>
    
    <p>You're babysitting, while your waiting for the elevator with the kids (8, 11 y/o) they ask you to play some music. Specifically Francisco Lindor's walk in song. You look for it and realize its My Girl by The Temptations and the three of you start jamming while waiting for the elevator.</p>
    <p>A senior couple arrives. Immediately the man say "Wow, The Temptations, who would have thought". They start singing and jamming too. The boys are shy so they stop singing, but you and the older couple keep singing. </p>
    <p>The elevator arrives. You all get in. The boys pause the music. The older couple say "Go ahead keep playing the song". After a few seconds of consideration the boys start playing the song. </p>
    <p>You all start singing together</p>
